Reviewing pull requests


Reviewing incoming pull requests is an open process where anyone can participate and give improvement suggestions. That being said, accepting a pull request can be done by a core team member. The general guidelines for code review are given below.

As a reviewer, you need to ensure

    Add yourself as a reviewer
    Put under review badge to the pull request
    Check that the code compiles and the existing tests succeed (Travis build does this)
     Does the example code have proper tests and enough test coverage?
    Is the example code commented well enough?
    Are the project coding conventions being followed (Checkstyle handles this and fails the build in case of deviations)?
