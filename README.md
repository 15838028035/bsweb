Contributing

Contributions are absolutely welcome. Unfortunately, Xamarin is a paid framework which makes it hard for contributors but if you'd like to create a PR I would be happen to test it.

    Fork it!
    Create your feature branch: git checkout -b my-new-feature
    Commit your changes: git commit -am 'Add some feature'
    Push to the branch: git push origin my-new-feature
    Submit a pull request :D
